# Level 2: Classification of PDEs

::: {.dialogue}
**Pavni:** Acharya, last time you told me how PDEs were born from strings, heat, and flows. But there seem to be so many kinds of PDEs. How do we organize them?  

**Acharya:** A good question, Pavni. Mathematicians classify PDEs in several ways, much like a botanist classifies plants. Let us begin with the simplest.  

**Pavni:** I am listening.  

**Acharya:** First, by **order**. A PDE is first-order if the highest derivative is first order, second-order if the highest is second, and so on. For example, the transport equation $u_t + c u_x = 0$ is first-order, while the heat equation $u_t = \alpha u_{xx}$ is second-order.  

**Pavni:** That part seems simple enough. What else?  

**Acharya:** Next comes **linearity**. A PDE is linear if the unknown function and its derivatives appear only linearly — not multiplied together, not inside a sine or square. The heat equation is linear. But if you had a term like $u u_x$, that would make it nonlinear.  

**Pavni:** So, nonlinear PDEs are trickier?  

**Acharya:** Very much so! Nonlinearity makes life both harder and richer.  

**Pavni:** Are there other distinctions?  

**Acharya:** Yes. Equations can be **homogeneous** or **inhomogeneous** depending on whether the right-hand side is zero. Laplace’s equation is homogeneous, Poisson’s equation is inhomogeneous.  

**Acharya:** More generally, a non-homogeneous PDE can be written as:  
$$ F(t, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, u, u_t, u_{x_1}, \dots, u_{x_n}, u_{tt}, u_{x_1x_1}, \dots) = g(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, t), $$  
where $g$ is a nonzero source or forcing term. If $g \equiv 0$, the PDE is homogeneous.  

**Pavni:** So the right-hand side introduces an external influence, like heat sources or forces?  

**Acharya:** Exactly. For example, $u_{xx} + u_{yy} = f(x,y)$ is the Poisson equation with a source term $f(x,y)$.  .  

**Pavni:** I think I follow. But I have also heard words like elliptic and hyperbolic. What do they mean?  

**Acharya:** Ah, those arise for **second-order PDEs in two variables**. Suppose we have:  
$$ A u_{xx} + B u_{xy} + C u_{yy} + \dots = 0. $$  
We look at the discriminant: $B^2 - 4AC$.  
- If it is less than 0, the PDE is **elliptic** (like Laplace’s equation).  
- If it equals 0, the PDE is **parabolic** (like the heat equation).  
- If it is greater than 0, the PDE is **hyperbolic** (like the wave equation).  

**Pavni:** This reminds me of conic sections! Circles, parabolas, and hyperbolas.  

**Acharya:** Exactly. The analogy is deliberate — both come from the same quadratic form.  

**Pavni:** And physically?  

**Acharya:** Elliptic equations describe steady states — like equilibrium temperature distributions. Parabolic equations describe diffusion, the smoothing of irregularities over time. Hyperbolic equations describe wave-like motion, signals traveling with finite speed.  

**Pavni:** That helps me imagine them. So classification is not just a game, but it tells us the nature of the solutions.  

**Acharya:** Well said, Pavni. And it also guides how we design numerical methods. An elliptic problem requires different strategies than a hyperbolic one.  

**Pavni:** Then I am eager to learn those strategies!  

**Acharya:** Patience, Pavni. First we must prepare the ground. Classification is the map; numerical methods are the journey.
