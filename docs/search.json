    "text": "Pavni: Acharya, where did all these partial differential equations come from? They seem so abstract.\nAcharya: Ah, Pavni, they did not begin in abstraction. They began with strings, heat, and the mysteries of the heavens.\nPavni: Strings? You mean music?\nAcharya: Exactly! In 1746, d’Alembert studied how a vibrating string produces sound. From that, he wrote down the wave equation. Soon after, Euler extended it to drums and membranes. So you see, music and mathematics are deeply connected.\nPavni: That’s beautiful! And the heat equation?\nAcharya: That came from Joseph Fourier in the early 1800s. He asked: How does heat spread through a solid body? His answer was the heat equation, and in solving it he gave us the gift of Fourier series.\nPavni: So Fourier series were born from studying heat?\nAcharya: Precisely. And then Laplace studied gravitational attraction and derived the Laplace equation, describing potentials in physics. Poisson later generalized it with the Poisson equation, where sources appear inside the field.\nPavni: So each new equation came from a real phenomenon.\nAcharya: Just so. Later, in the 19th century, Navier and Stokes wrote down the equations of fluid motion — the Navier–Stokes equations. Even today, their mysteries are not fully solved.\nPavni: (smiling) So PDEs are not just formulas on paper. They are echoes of sound, flows of heat, gravity, and water.\nAcharya: Well said, Pavni. They are the language by which nature speaks to us.",

Then \\[\nB u^{(n+1)} = u^{(n)},\n\\] where \\[\nB =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1+2\\lambda & -\\lambda     &            &            &   \\\\\n-\\lambda    & 1+2\\lambda  & -\\lambda   &            &   \\\\\n            & \\ddots      & \\ddots     & \\ddots     &   \\\\\n            &             & -\\lambda   & 1+2\\lambda & -\\lambda \\\\\n            &             &            & -\\lambda   & 1+2\\lambda\n\\end{bmatrix}_{(N_x-2)\\times(N_x-2)}.\n\\]\nSo each step requires solving the linear system \\[\nu^{(n+1)} = B^{-1} u^{(n)}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n5.5.3 Stability\n\nPavni: Doesn’t that make it more expensive than FTCS?\nAcharya: It does, because we must solve a tridiagonal system at every time step.\nBut the reward is unconditional stability: for any \\(\\Delta t &gt; 0\\) and \\(\\Delta x &gt; 0\\), the scheme does not blow up.\nPavni: So no restriction like \\(\\lambda \\leq \\tfrac{1}{2}\\)?\nAcharya: Exactly. Backward Euler is stable for all \\(\\lambda\\).\nIt is only first-order accurate in time (like FTCS), but still second-order in space.\n\n\n\n\n5.5.4 Remarks\n\nBackward Euler is more robust but requires solving a linear system at each step.\n\nFor large systems, efficient algorithms like the Thomas algorithm (specialized Gaussian elimination for tridiagonal matrices) are used.\n\nIn practice, one balances cost (explicit FTCS, cheap but conditionally stable) against robustness (implicit Backward Euler, unconditionally stable).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhy the Backward Euler scheme is unconditionally stable\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the update is\n\\[\nu^{(n+1)} = A u^{(n)},\n\\]\nand the initial error is \\(e^0\\), then after \\(n\\) steps the error is\n\\[\ne^{(n)} = A^n e^0.\n\\]\nAs before, the asymptotic condition is that the spectral radius \\(\\rho(A)&lt;1\\).\n\n\n5.5.4.1 Eigenvalues of the Backward Euler iteration matrix\nThe Backward Euler scheme for the heat equation is\n\\[\n\\frac{U^{n+1} - U^n}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha^2 A U^{n+1},\n\\] which rearranges to\n\\[\nU^{n+1} = (I - \\lambda A)^{-1} U^n,\n\\qquad \\lambda = \\frac{\\alpha^2 \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}.\n\\]\n\nIf \\(\\lambda_i(A)\\) are the eigenvalues of the discrete Laplacian \\(A\\),\nthen the eigenvalues of the iteration matrix are \\[\n\\mu_i = \\frac{1}{1 - \\lambda_i(A)}.\n\\]\nFor the 1D Laplacian with Dirichlet BCs, \\[\n\\lambda_i(A) = -4 \\sin^2\\!\\left(\\frac{i\\pi}{2m}\\right),\n\\qquad i=1,2,\\dots,m-1.\n\\]\n\nThus \\[\n\\mu_i = \\frac{1}{1 + 4\\lambda \\sin^2\\!\\left(\\frac{i\\pi}{2m}\\right)}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n5.5.4.2 Stability condition\n\nSince \\(\\lambda&gt;0\\) and \\(\\sin^2(\\cdot)\\ge0\\),\nthe denominator is always greater than \\(1\\).\n\nTherefore \\[\n0 &lt; \\mu_i &lt; 1, \\qquad \\forall i.\n\\]\n\nThis means all eigenvalues of the iteration matrix lie strictly inside the unit circle.\n\n✅ Thus, the Backward Euler scheme is unconditionally stable: - No restriction on \\(\\Delta t\\).\n- Every mode decays monotonically.\n- In contrast, FTCS required \\(\\lambda \\le \\tfrac{1}{2}\\) for stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5.5 Interactive plots to see the eigenvalues of FTCS and Backward Differencce methods\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\n\nHow to interact with the plots - Move the slider to change \\(\\lambda = \\tfrac{\\alpha^2 \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\\).\n- FTCS plot: notice that for \\(\\lambda &gt; 0.5\\) some eigenvalues leave \\([-1,1]\\), indicating instability.\n- Backward Euler plot: eigenvalues always remain in \\((0,1)\\), showing unconditional stability.\n- Hover over points to see their values, zoom by dragging, double-click to reset.",

Does every PDE behave like that?\nAcharya: That’s a good observation, Pavni. Not every PDE diffuses information infinitely fast like the parabolic heat equation.\nSome equations describe situations where information or disturbances travel at a finite speed — like waves or moving traffic.\nPavni: So these are called hyperbolic equations?\nAcharya: Exactly. Hyperbolic equations are the mathematical way of describing signals or quantities that move through a medium rather than diffuse.\nFor example — a vibrating string, sound waves in air, or even cars moving on a road.\nPavni: Interesting! But why are they so different from diffusion equations like the heat equation?\nAcharya: Because diffusion equations allow disturbances to spread instantaneously everywhere — a small change at one point affects all others immediately.\nThat’s called infinite propagation speed.\nBut hyperbolic equations restrict influence to certain paths in the \\((x,t)\\)-plane, called characteristics.\nInformation travels only along these paths at a finite speed.\nPavni: That sounds more physical.

This equation may look simple, but it contains a beautiful idea — that information travels along certain paths in the \\((x,t)\\)-plane. These paths are called characteristics.\n\n\n6.4.1 Deriving the Characteristic Curves\nAcharya: Let’s think of \\(\\rho\\) as a function of both \\(x\\) and \\(t\\).\nSuppose we move along a curve \\(x = x(t)\\) in the \\((x,t)\\)-plane.\nBy the chain rule, the total derivative of \\(\\rho\\) along that curve is \\[\n\\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = \\rho_t + \\frac{dx}{dt}\\rho_x.\n\\]\nNow, if we choose \\(\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = a\\), then \\[\n\\frac{d\\rho}{dt} = \\rho_t + a\\rho_x = 0.\n\\]\nThat means \\(\\rho\\) is constant along any curve that satisfies \\(\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = a\\).\nPavni: So those are the characteristic curves?\nAcharya: Exactly! Integrating \\(\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = a\\) gives \\[\nx = a t + x_0, \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - a t = x_0 = \\text{constant}.\n\\]\nEach line \\(x - a t = \\text{constant}\\) is a characteristic line.\n\n\n\n6.4.2 The Meaning of Characteristics\nPavni: What does it mean that \\(\\rho\\) is constant along these lines?\nAcharya: It means that the value of \\(\\rho\\) at time \\(t\\) and position \\(x\\)\nis exactly the same as its value at the point where that characteristic line started on the \\(x\\)-axis (that is, at time \\(t=0\\)).\nSo, \\[\n\\rho(x,t) = \\rho_0(x - a t),\n\\] where \\(\\rho_0(x)\\) is the initial density at \\(t=0\\).\nPavni: Oh! So the initial profile just shifts by \\(a t\\)?\nAcharya: Exactly — it moves to the right if \\(a&gt;0\\) and to the left if \\(a&lt;0\\).\nNo change in shape — pure translation.\n\n\n\n6.4.3 Verifying the Solution\nPavni: Let’s check if this really satisfies the PDE.\nAcharya: Sure! Let \\(\\rho(x,t) = \\rho_0(x - a t)\\).\nThen \\[\n\\rho_t = -a\\rho_0'(x - a t), \\quad \\rho_x = \\rho_0'(x - a t).\n\\] Substitute into \\(\\rho_t + a\\rho_x = 0\\): \\[\n(-a\\rho_0') + a\\rho_0' = 0.\n\\] ✅ It satisfies the equation perfectly.\n\n\n\n6.4.4 Understanding Finite Propagation Speed\nAcharya: The key property of this equation is that information moves at a finite speed.\nIf a disturbance is initially present only between \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=1\\),\nthen at time \\(t\\) it will be found only between \\(x=a t\\) and \\(x=1+a t\\).\nEvery point outside this region remains unaffected.\nPavni: So information doesn’t spread instantly like in the heat equation?\nAcharya: Exactly. In the heat equation, even a small bump affects the whole line immediately — infinite propagation speed.\nBut here, the influence travels only along straight lines \\(x - a t = \\text{constant}\\) — that’s finite-speed propagation.\n\n\n\n6.4.5 Example\nLet’s take an initial density \\[\n\\rho_0(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & 0 &lt; x &lt; 1, \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThen \\[\n\\rho(x,t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1, & a t &lt; x &lt; 1 + a t, \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nPavni: So the block of cars just moves forward as a group?\nAcharya: Exactly — like a moving traffic wave with constant shape.\n\n\n\n6.4.6 Visualizing Characteristics\nEach characteristic line shows where information travels:\nt ↑\n  |\n  |       /    /    /    /    /    /    /\n  |      /    /    /    /    /    /    /\n  |     /    /    /    /    /    /    /\n  |____/____/____/____/____/____/____/→ x",

    "text": "6.5 🕸️ Domain of Dependence and Domain of Influence\nPavni: Acharya, you mentioned earlier that information in hyperbolic equations travels along characteristics. But how exactly do we describe which parts of the initial data influence the solution at a given point?\nAcharya: Excellent question, Pavni. To answer that, we introduce two key ideas — the domain of dependence and the domain of influence. These describe how information moves through space and time.\n\n\n6.5.1 What do these mean?\nAcharya: Let’s begin intuitively.\n\nThe domain of dependence (DoD) of a point \\((x,t)\\) is the set of points in the initial data that can affect the solution at \\((x,t)\\).\nIn other words: Which initial points influence the value here?\nThe domain of influence (DoI) of a point \\((x_0,0)\\) is the set of space–time points \\((x,t)\\) that can be affected by that initial point.\nIn other words: Where does the information starting at \\(x_0\\) go?\n\nPavni: So the DoD looks backward in time, and the DoI looks forward?\nAcharya: Exactly. They’re like mirror images of each other.\nFor hyperbolic PDEs, these regions are bounded by characteristics — the paths along which information travels at finite speed.\n\n\n\n6.5.2 Example 1: Linear Advection\nPavni: Let’s try this with the advection equation again:\n\\[\nu_t + a\\,u_x = 0, \\quad u(x,0) = u_0(x).\n\\]\nAcharya: Good. The characteristics are the straight lines \\[\nx - a t = \\text{constant}.\n\\]\nSo each point \\((x,t)\\) connects to exactly one point on the \\(x\\)–axis: \\(x_0 = x - a t\\).\nPavni: So the value \\(u(x,t)\\) depends only on \\(u_0(x - a t)\\)?\nAcharya: Exactly. That means:\n\nThe domain of dependence of \\((x,t)\\) is the single point \\(x_0 = x - a t\\).\n\nThe domain of influence of an initial point \\((x_0,0)\\) is the straight line \\(x = x_0 + a t\\).\n\nPavni: So for advection, both DoD and DoI are just lines — not regions?\nAcharya: Right. A single characteristic line carries all the information.\nThis is why the advection equation has such a clean propagation behavior — each point of initial data simply moves at speed \\(a\\) without interacting with others.\n\n\n\n6.5.3 Example 2: The 1-D Wave Equation\nPavni: What happens for the wave equation?\n\\[\nu_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx}.\n\\]\nAcharya: Ah, this one is a bit richer. The general solution is given by d’Alembert’s formula: \\[\nu(x,t) = F(x - c t) + G(x + c t).\n\\]\nPavni: So now we have two families of characteristics — one moving right, one left?\nAcharya: Precisely! For this equation: - Right-moving characteristics: \\(x - c t = \\text{constant}\\)\n- Left-moving characteristics: \\(x + c t = \\text{constant}\\)\nNow, to find the value at \\((x,t)\\), you need both \\(F\\) and \\(G\\) — meaning information from two points on the initial line: \\[\nx - c t \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x + c t.\n\\]\nPavni: So the DoD of \\((x,t)\\) is the interval between those two points?\nAcharya: Yes. The domain of dependence is\n\\[\n[x - c t,\\, x + c t].\n\\]\nAnd the domain of influence of an initial point \\((x_0,0)\\) is the cone-shaped region.",

That’s not physical.\nAcharya: Exactly — in reality, when cars catch up, a shock forms — a sharp front separating high and low densities.\nThe PDE solution must then be replaced by a weak solution that allows for discontinuities satisfying the Rankine–Hugoniot condition.",

Can we work through a concrete example — step by step — and actually see the shock form?\nAcharya: Absolutely. Let’s use the simple traffic-inspired Burgers’-type model we had earlier: \\[\n\\rho_t + (1-2\\rho)\\,\\rho_x = 0,\n\\] so the characteristic speed is \\[\nc(\\rho) = 1 - 2\\rho.\n\\]\nWe will pick an initial condition that produces a shock: \\[\n\\rho(x,0)=\\begin{cases}\n0.2, & x&lt;0,\\\\[4pt]\n0.8, & x&gt;0.\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nPavni: That’s the case where the left side is sparse (fast) and the right side is dense (slow), so I expect traffic from the left to run into slow traffic on the right. That should make a shock, right?\nAcharya: Exactly. Let’s make the statements precise.\n\nLeft state: \\(\\rho_L=0.2 \\Rightarrow c_L = 1-2(0.2)=0.6\\) (moves right).\n\nRight state: \\(\\rho_R=0.8 \\Rightarrow c_R = 1-2(0.8)=-0.6\\) (moves left).\n\nThe two families of characteristics coming from left and right collide — they cross in the \\((x,t)\\)-plane — so the continuous solution breaks down and a shock forms.\nPavni: And the shock speed is given by the Rankine–Hugoniot condition?\nAcharya: Correct. For a conservation law \\(\\rho_t + f(\\rho)_x=0\\) the shock speed \\(s\\) satisfies \\[\ns = \\frac{f(\\rho_L)-f(\\rho_R)}{\\rho_L-\\rho_R}.\n\\] Here \\(f(\\rho)=\\rho(1-\\rho)\\), so for our numbers \\[\nf(\\rho_L)=0.2(0.8)=0.16,\\qquad f(\\rho_R)=0.8(0.2)=0.16,\n\\] hence \\(s = \\dfrac{0.16-0.16}{0.2-0.8}=0\\).\nSo this particular shock is stationary — the discontinuity sits at \\(x=0\\) while characteristics run into it.",

    "text": "8.1 Von Neumann analysis for the FTCS scheme\nPavni: We already checked stability for the FTCS heat solver using the matrix (eigenvalue) approach. I want to see the Fourier-mode (von Neumann) method – the frequency-by-frequency picture.\nAcharya: Sure. The von Neumann method tests how individual sinusoidal (Fourier) modes are amplified (or damped) by a linear, constant-coefficient finite-difference scheme. Because such schemes act independently on each Fourier mode, we can study one mode at a time and require every mode to be non-amplifying.\nAcharya: Let’s start from the 1-D heat equation\n\\[\nu_t = \\alpha\\,u_{xx}, \\qquad \\alpha &gt; 0,\n\\]\ndiscretized on a uniform grid \\(x_j = j\\,\\Delta x\\), \\(t_n = n\\,\\Delta t\\) with the explicit Forward-Time Centered-Space (FTCS) scheme\n\\[\nu_j^{\\,n+1} = u_j^{\\,n}\n  + r\\big(u_{j+1}^{\\,n} - 2u_j^{\\,n} + u_{j-1}^{\\,n}\\big),\n  \\qquad r := \\alpha\\,\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x^2}.\n\\]\n(When studying errors we set \\(e_j^n = u_j^n - u(x_j,t_n)\\).)\nPavni: Why can we assume a Fourier (sinusoidal) form for the error?\nAcharya: Because the scheme is linear with constant coefficients. That means if you feed a single Fourier mode into the linear update, it stays a Fourier mode – only its amplitude changes. Fourier modes form a basis for discrete periodic signals, so studying one mode suffices.\nAssume an error (or mode) of the form\n\\[\ne_j^n = \\xi^n e^{i k x_j},\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the spatial wavenumber and \\(\\xi\\) (the amplification factor) is the complex number that tells how the mode’s amplitude changes per time step.\nPavni: Plug that into the error update.\nAcharya: The error update mirrors the scheme:\n\\[\ne_j^{\\,n+1}\n  = e_j^{\\,n}\n  + r\\big(e_{j+1}^{\\,n} - 2e_j^{\\,n} + e_{j-1}^{\\,n}\\big).\n\\]\nSubstitute \\(e_j^{\\,n} = \\xi^n e^{i k x_j}\\) and \\(x_{j\\pm1} = x_j \\pm \\Delta x\\):\n\\[\n\\xi^{n+1} e^{i k x_j}\n  = \\xi^n e^{i k x_j}\n  + r\\,\\xi^n\\!\\left(e^{i k (x_j+\\Delta x)} - 2 e^{i k x_j} + e^{i k (x_j-\\Delta x)}\\right).\n\\]\nCancel the common nonzero factor \\(\\xi^n e^{i k x_j}\\) to get\n\\[\n\\xi = 1 + r\\!\\left(e^{i k \\Delta x} - 2 + e^{-i k \\Delta x}\\right).\n\\]\nUse \\(e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta} = 2\\cos\\theta\\) and simplify:\n\\[\n\\xi = 1 + 2r(\\cos(k\\Delta x)-1)\n    = 1 - 4r\\sin^2\\!\\left(\\frac{k\\Delta x}{2}\\right).\n\\]\nThis is the amplification factor for a Fourier mode of wavenumber \\(k\\).",
