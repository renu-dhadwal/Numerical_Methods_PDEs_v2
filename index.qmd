Numerical Methods for PDEs: An Interactive Journey
---

# Welcome

Welcome to this interactive journey through **Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**.  

You will explore the subject through **dialogues between Acharya and Pavni**, discovering history, classification, and numerical methods step by step.

## Levels

- [Level 1: Origins of PDEs](chapters/level1_history_pdes.qmd)
- [Level 2: Classification of PDEs](chapters/Level2_classification_pdes.qmd)
- [Level 3: Physical Interpretation and boundary conditions](chapters/level3_PDE_BCs.qmd)
- [Level 4: Finite Difference Methods- Introduction with application to the Heat Eqaution](chapters/level4_finite_differences.qmd)
- [Level 5 : Hyperbolic PDEs - Wave Equation](chapters/level5_Wave_Equation.qmd)
