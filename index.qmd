title: "Numerical Methods for PDEs: An Interactive Journey"
---

# Welcome

Welcome to this interactive journey through **Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)**.  

You will explore the subject through **dialogues between Acharya and Pavni**, discovering history, classification, and numerical methods step by step.

## Levels

- [Level 1: Origins of PDEs](chapters/level1_history_pdes.qmd)
- [Level 2: Classification of PDEs](chapters/Level2_classification_pdes.qmd)
- [Level 3: Finite Difference Methods- Introduction](chapters/level3_finite_differences.qmd)

---

Stay tuned as new levels unlock â€” from classification of PDEs to discretization techniques and beyond!
