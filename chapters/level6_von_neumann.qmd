**Pavni:** We already checked stability for the FTCS heat solver using the matrix (eigenvalue) approach. I want to see the Fourier-mode (von Neumann) method -- the frequency-by-frequency picture.

**Acharya:** Sure. The von Neumann method tests how individual sinusoidal (Fourier) modes are amplified (or damped) by a linear, constant-coefficient finite-difference scheme. Because such schemes act independently on each Fourier mode, we can study one mode at a time and require every mode to be non-amplifying.

## Von Neumann analysis for the FTCS scheme

**Acharya:** Let's start from the 1-D heat equation

$$
u_t = \alpha\,u_{xx}, \qquad \alpha > 0,
$$

discretized on a uniform grid $x_j = j\,\Delta x$, $t_n = n\,\Delta t$ with the explicit Forward-Time Centered-Space (FTCS) scheme

$$
u_j^{\,n+1} = u_j^{\,n}
  + r\big(u_{j+1}^{\,n} - 2u_j^{\,n} + u_{j-1}^{\,n}\big),
  \qquad r := \alpha\,\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}.
$$

(When studying errors we set $e_j^n = u_j^n - u(x_j,t_n)$.)

**Pavni:** Why can we assume a Fourier (sinusoidal) form for the error?

**Acharya:** Because the scheme is linear with constant coefficients. That means if you feed a single Fourier mode into the linear update, it stays a Fourier mode -- only its amplitude changes. Fourier modes form a basis for discrete periodic signals, so studying one mode suffices.

Assume an error (or mode) of the form

$$
e_j^n = \xi^n e^{i k x_j},
$$

where $k$ is the spatial wavenumber and $\xi$ (the amplification factor) is the complex number that tells how the mode's amplitude changes per time step.

**Pavni:** Plug that into the error update.

**Acharya:** The error update mirrors the scheme:

$$
e_j^{\,n+1}
  = e_j^{\,n}
  + r\big(e_{j+1}^{\,n} - 2e_j^{\,n} + e_{j-1}^{\,n}\big).
$$

Substitute $e_j^{\,n} = \xi^n e^{i k x_j}$ and $x_{j\pm1} = x_j \pm \Delta x$:

$$
\xi^{n+1} e^{i k x_j}
  = \xi^n e^{i k x_j}
  + r\,\xi^n\!\left(e^{i k (x_j+\Delta x)} - 2 e^{i k x_j} + e^{i k (x_j-\Delta x)}\right).
$$

Cancel the common nonzero factor $\xi^n e^{i k x_j}$ to get

$$
\xi = 1 + r\!\left(e^{i k \Delta x} - 2 + e^{-i k \Delta x}\right).
$$

Use $e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta$ and simplify:

$$
\xi = 1 + 2r(\cos(k\Delta x)-1)
    = 1 - 4r\sin^2\!\left(\frac{k\Delta x}{2}\right).
$$

This is the amplification factor for a Fourier mode of wavenumber $k$.

## Stability condition

**Pavni:** So what condition on $r$ ensures stability?

**Acharya:** For stability we require that every Fourier mode is not amplified, i.e.

$$
|\xi| \le 1 \quad\text{for all allowed } k.
$$

For this FTCS case $\xi$ is real, so the requirement reduces to $-1 \le \xi \le 1$.  
The maximum value of $\xi$ is $1$ (when $\sin^2=0$), so we only need to check the minimum.  
The minimum occurs when $\sin^2(\cdot)=1$, giving $\xi_{\min}=1-4r$.  
Requiring $\xi_{\min}\ge -1$ gives

$$
1 - 4r \ge -1 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad r \le \tfrac12.
$$

Hence the von Neumann stability condition is

$$
\boxed{
  \alpha\,\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \le \tfrac12
  \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad
  \Delta t \le \frac{\Delta x^2}{2\alpha}.
}
$$

## Comments and interpretation

- Long (low-frequency) modes have $\sin^2\!\approx (k\Delta x/2)^2$ and so $\xi$ is near 1; they decay slowly.  
- Short (high-frequency) modes have $\sin^2$ near 1 and are damped more strongly (smaller $\xi$).  
- If $r>1/2$, the shortest modes have $\xi<-1$ leading to oscillatory growth and instability.  
- The von Neumann method is equivalent to the matrix/eigenvalue analysis for linear constant-coefficient schemes on periodic grids. Fourier modes are eigenvectors of circulant matrices; $\xi(k)$ are the eigenvalues.

**Answer (sketch).**  
For $k=0$, $\sin^2(0)=0$ so $\xi=1$ (constant mode preserved).  
For $k=\pi/\Delta x$, $\sin^2(\pi/2)=1$ so $\xi=1-4r$ (maximal damping; needs $r\le 1/2$ for stability).

## Von Neumann analysis for the Upwind and Lax–Friedrichs schemes

**Pavni:** Now that we finished the heat equation, can we do von Neumann analysis for a hyperbolic equation -- say, the linear advection equation?

**Acharya:** Perfect next step. Let's take the simplest hyperbolic PDE:

$$
u_t + a\,u_x = 0, \qquad a>0.
$$

The exact solution is a wave that travels to the right at speed $a$ without changing shape.

### 1. Upwind scheme

**Pavni:** Remind me of the upwind finite-difference scheme?

**Acharya:** For $a>0$, we use the backward spatial difference:

$$
u_j^{\,n+1} = u_j^{\,n} - C\,(u_j^{\,n} - u_{j-1}^{\,n}),
$$

where $C = a\,\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}$ is the Courant number.

Assume $e_j^n = \xi^n e^{i k x_j}$ and substitute to obtain

$$
\xi = 1 - C(1 - e^{-i k \Delta x})
    = 1 - C\!\big(1 - \cos(k\Delta x) + i\sin(k\Delta x)\big).
$$

Then

$$
|\xi|^2
  = [1 - C(1-\cos(k\Delta x))]^2 + [C\sin(k\Delta x)]^2
  = 1 - 2C(1-C)(1-\cos(k\Delta x)).
$$

Because $1-\cos(\cdot)\ge0$, the scheme is stable if $0\le C\le1$:

$$
\boxed{\,0 \le a\,\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \le 1.\,}
$$

### 2. Lax–Friedrichs scheme

The Lax–Friedrichs scheme is

$$
u_j^{\,n+1}
  = \tfrac12(u_{j+1}^{\,n}+u_{j-1}^{\,n})
    - \tfrac{C}{2}(u_{j+1}^{\,n}-u_{j-1}^{\,n}),
$$

which gives

$$
\xi = \cos(k\Delta x) - i\,C\sin(k\Delta x),
\qquad
|\xi|^2 = 1 - (1-C^2)\sin^2(k\Delta x).
$$

Stability requires $|C|\le1$:

$$
\boxed{\,|a|\,\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \le 1.\,}
$$

<details>
<summary><b>Optional check</b>: small-wavenumber expansions</summary>

For small $k\Delta x$, expand $\sin$ and $\cos$ to second order:

- **Upwind:** leading amplitude decay $\sim e^{-(1-C)(k\Delta x)^2/2}$.  
- **Lax–Friedrichs:** leading amplitude decay $\sim e^{-(1-C^2)(k\Delta x)^2/2}$.

Hence Lax–Friedrichs damps short waves more strongly.

**Pavni:** So both methods are stable under $|C|\le1$, but upwind is less diffusive.

**Acharya:** Exactly -- von Neumann analysis clearly shows the trade-offs among stability, dissipation, and dispersion.
