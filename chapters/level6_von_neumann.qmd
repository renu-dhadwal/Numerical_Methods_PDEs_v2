# Von Neumann Analysis
**Pavni:** We already checked stability for the FTCS heat solver using the matrix (eigenvalue) approach. I want to see the Fourier-mode (von Neumann) method — the frequency-by-frequency picture. Please explain it like I'm an undergrad.

**Acharya:** Sure. The von Neumann method tests how individual sinusoidal (Fourier) modes are amplified (or damped) by a linear, constant-coefficient finite-difference scheme. Because such schemes act independently on each Fourier mode, we can study one mode at a time and require every mode to be non-amplifying.

# Setup: PDE and FTCS scheme

**Acharya:** Start from the 1-D heat equation

$$
u_t = \alpha\, u_{xx}, \qquad \alpha > 0,
$$

discretized on a uniform grid $x_j = j\Delta x$, $t_n = n\Delta t$ with the explicit Forward-Time Centered-Space (FTCS) scheme

$$
u_j^{\,n+1}=u_j^{\,n}+r\big(u_{j+1}^{\,n}-2u_j^{\,n}+u_{j-1}^{\,n}\big),\qquad r:=\alpha\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}.
$$

(When studying errors we set $e_j^n = u_j^n - u(x_j,t_n)$.)

# Dialogue: von Neumann derivation

**Pavni:** Why can we assume a Fourier (sinusoidal) form for the error?

**Acharya:** Because the scheme is linear with constant coefficients. That means if you feed a single Fourier mode into the linear update, it stays a Fourier mode — only its amplitude changes. Fourier modes form a basis for discrete periodic signals, so studying one mode suffices.

Assume an error (or mode) of the form

$$
e_j^n = \xi^n e^{i k x_j},
$$

where $k$ is the spatial wavenumber and $\xi$ (the amplification factor) is the complex number that tells how the mode's amplitude changes per time step.

**Pavni:** Plug that into the error update.

**Acharya:** The error update mirrors the scheme:

$$
e_j^{n+1} = e_j^n + r\big(e_{j+1}^n - 2e_j^n + e_{j-1}^n\big).
$$

Substitute $e_j^n = \xi^n e^{i k x_j}$ and $x_{j\pm1} = x_j \pm \Delta x$:

$$
\xi^{n+1} e^{i k x_j} = \xi^n e^{i k x_j} + r\xi^n\big(e^{i k (x_j+\Delta x)} - 2 e^{i k x_j} + e^{i k (x_j-\Delta x)}\big).
$$

Cancel the common nonzero factor $\xi^n e^{i k x_j}$ to get

$$
\xi = 1 + r\big(e^{i k \Delta x} - 2 + e^{-i k \Delta x}\big).
$$

Use $e^{i\theta}+e^{-i\theta}=2\cos\theta$ and simplify:

$$
\xi = 1 + 2r(\cos(k\Delta x)-1) = 1 - 4r\sin^2\!\left(\frac{k\Delta x}{2}\right).
$$

This is the amplification factor for a Fourier mode of wavenumber $k$.

# Stability condition

**Pavni:** So what condition on $r$ ensures stability?

**Acharya:** For stability we require that every Fourier mode is not amplified, i.e.

$$
|\xi| \le 1 \quad\text{for all allowed } k.
$$

For this FTCS case $\xi$ is real, so the requirement reduces to $-1 \le \xi \le 1$. The maximum value of $\xi$ is $1$ (when $\sin^2=0$), so we only need to check the minimum. The minimum occurs when $\sin^2(\cdot)=1$, giving $\xi_{\min}=1-4r$. Requiring $\xi_{\min}\ge-1$ gives

$$
1-4r \ge -1 \quad\Longrightarrow\quad r \le \tfrac12.
$$

Hence the von Neumann stability condition is

$$
\boxed{\qquad \alpha\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} \le \tfrac12 \quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad \Delta t \le \frac{\Delta x^2}{2\alpha}\,.}
$$

# Comments and interpretation

- Long (low-frequency) modes have $\sin^2\!\approx (k\Delta x/2)^2$ and so $\xi$ is near $1$; they decay slowly.  
- Short (high-frequency) modes have $\sin^2$ near $1$ and so are damped more strongly (smaller $\xi$).  
- If $r>1/2$ then the shortest modes have $\xi<-1$ leading to oscillatory growth and instability.  
- The von Neumann method is equivalent to the matrix/eigenvalue analysis for linear constant-coefficient schemes on periodic grids. Fourier modes are eigenvectors of circulant matrices; $\xi(k)$ are the eigenvalues.

# Quick exercise

> **Exercise.** For the heat equation FTCS scheme above, compute $\xi(k)$ for the two extreme wavenumbers on a grid with $N$ points and periodic boundary conditions: $k=0$ and the Nyquist mode $k=\pi/\Delta x$. Interpret the values.

**Answer (sketch).** For $k=0$, $\sin^2(0)=0$ so $\xi=1$ (constant mode preserved). For $k=\pi/\Delta x$, $\sin^2(\pi/2)=1$ so $\xi=1-4r$ (the maximal damping; needs $r\le 1/2$ to avoid instability).
